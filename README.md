# Titanlib 

![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/metno/titanlib/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

Titanlib is a library of automatic quality control routines for in-situ observations with an emphasis on
spatial checks. It is written in C++ and has bindings for python and R. The library consists of a set of
functions that perform tests on data.

Titanlib is currently under development.

## Features

- A wide variety of spatial checks, such as **spatial consistency test**, **buddy check**, **isolation check**.
- Plausability tests such as **range check** and **climatology check**.
- A graphical interface for tuning the parameters of the checks
- Fast C++ implementation for efficient processing of large observation datasets 

## Installation

Here are installation instructions for Ubuntu Bionic. First, install the pre-requisites:

```
sudo apt install swig doxygen r-base-core libboost-dev libproj-dev cmake libgsl-dev python3-setuptools python3-nose python3-numpy python3-scipy
```

Next, configure the installation cmake. Create a build directory and perform the
installation there:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```

To compile the library and bindings, run

```bash
make all
sudo make install
```

To install the bindings, run
```bash
make install-python-user
make build-r
```

This will install the library in `/usr/local/lib/libtitanlib.so`, the python bindings in
`~/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/titanlib.py`. To install the python bindings
system-wide, use `sudo make install-python`.  Currently, the R package is not installed
centrally, but instead is placed in `SWIG/R/titanlib.R`.

## Python example

```python
import titanlib
status, flags = titanlib.sct([60,61],[10,11],[0,100],[-4,2],100,300,100,100,100,100,[2,2],[2,2],[2,2])
print(flags)
```

## R example

Run the following code in R from the build directory, or if you want to run from any other directory, just
put in the proper paths for rtitanlib and titanlib.R

```
dyn.load(paste("SWIG/R/titanlib", .Platform$dynlib.ext, sep=""))
source("SWIG/R/titanlib.R")
cacheMetaData(1)

sct(c(60,61), c(10,11), c(0,100), c(-4,2),100,300,100,100,100,100,c(2,2),c(2,2),c(2,2))
```

## Development instructions

The C++ library and python bindings can be installed separately like this:

```
sudo make install
sudo make install-python
```

To build the library and packages (and not install them), run:

```
make titanlib
make build-python
make build-r
```

*Unit tests* are written in the tests/ directory. The tests rely on the python interface to titanlib being installed (see above). Use nosetests3 to run all tests. First install the python library  and the nose package (pip3 install nose) then run the following:

```bash
nosetests3
```

To *build the documentation*, run the following from the build directory:

```bash
make doc_doxygen
```

The html documentation will appear in build/doxygen/html.

To build a *debug version* of the library, use the following options when running cmake:

```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
```
